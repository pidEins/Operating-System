This readme provides c++ programs to measure the memory access time, RAM bandwidth and page fault time. 

To compile all the programs
1. run "make" command in the Memory_Access directory.

Note: we need to run the exe as a admin because exe do some operations for which its needs admin permission. 

Note: To compile/build all the programs at once then run the make command in the top level directory.
