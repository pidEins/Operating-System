This readme provides c++ programs to measure the memory access time of L1 cache. 

To compile, please run this step 
1. run the "make" command.

Once you compiled the program successfully, you will get the executable. 
Run the executable to calculate L2 memory access time
1. run "sudo ./L2_memory_access_time"
   
Note: we need to run the exe as a admin because exe do some operations for which its needs admin permission. 

Note: To compile/build all the programs at once then run the make command in the top level directory.
