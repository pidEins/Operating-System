C/C++ programs to measure the Operating system performance in the following scenarios

1. CPU, Scheduling, and OS Services

    a. Measurement overhead: Report the overhead of reading time, and report the overhead of using a loop to measure many iterations of an operation.
    
    b. Procedure call overhead: Report as a function of number of integer arguments from 0-7. What is the increment overhead of an argument?
    
    c. System call overhead: Report the cost of a minimal system call. 
    
    d. Task creation time: Report the time to create and run both a process and a kernel thread. 
    
    e. Context switch time: Report the time to context switch from one process to another. 

2. Memory

    a. RAM access time: Report latency for individual integer accesses to main memory and the L1 and L2 caches.
    
    b. RAM bandwidth: Report bandwidth for both reading and writing. 
   
    c. Page fault service time: Report the time for faulting an entire page from disk (mmap is one useful mechanism).
