This readme provides c++ program to measure the context switch overhead of a process and thread. 

To compile, please run this step  
1. run the "make" command.

Once you compiled the program successfully, you will get the executable. 
Run the executable by running 
1. sudo ./context_switch
   
Note: we need to run the exe as a admin because exe do some operations for which its needs admin permission. 

Note: To compile/build all the programs at once then run the make command in the top level directory.
